# Machine Learning Algorithms Comparison with SMOTE

## Project Overview

In this project, we will apply various machine learning algorithms to a normalized and scaled dataset to evaluate their performance. The algorithms to be tested include:

- **LightGBM**
- **XGBoost**
- **Random Forest**
- **AdaBoost**
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**

### Objective

The main objective is to analyze the performance of these algorithms on a normalized dataset. Afterward, **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) will be applied to the normalized dataset to address class imbalance. The algorithms will then be tested again on the SMOTE-enhanced dataset to evaluate the impact of SMOTE on their performance.

### Status

My task is complete for now, and I will continue updating it as more steps are added.
