# EMPLOYEE TURNOVER PREDICTION WITH XAI 

## Project Overview

This project, supported by TÃœBÄ°TAK, aims to predict employee turnover using machine learning techniques and evaluate the effects of preprocessing, class balancing, discretization, and explainability on model performance and transparency.

## Workflow Summary:
## 1. Data Preprocessing:
The IBM HR Analytics dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to prepare for modeling. Missing values and class imbalance were analyzed and addressed.
## 2. Modeling:
Several machine learning models were trained and evaluated. Random Forest achieved the best performance and was selected as the primary model for subsequent stages.

## 3.SMOTE Techniques for Class Balancing:
Multiple SMOTE-based oversampling techniques were tested to handle class imbalance:

SMOTE-NC achieved the highest F1-score (0.93) among all techniques.

However, SMOTE-NC requires the entire dataset to be fully categorical. Since our dataset did not meet this condition, it was not suitable for practical implementation.

Therefore, we proceeded with KMeans-SMOTE, the next best-performing method that fit our dataset structure.

## 4. Discretization Methods (Tested Separately):
We evaluated seven different discretization techniques independently, without combining them with SMOTE, to assess their individual effects:

### Equal Width Binning

### Equal Frequency Binning

### KMeans Discretization

### KMeans++ (Fast Init)

### KMeans (Elbow Method)

### Decision Tree Discretization

### Normalized Decision Tree Discretization

âž¤ The KMeans++ method achieved the best result, increasing the F1-score up to 84.6%, demonstrating the importance of feature transformation.

## 5. Explainable AI (XAI):
To make model predictions more interpretable and transparent for human resource decision-makers, we applied:

### LIME
for local interpretability (individual predictions)

### SHAP
for both global and local feature importance analysis
